Python PyGame practice

As I’ve started to dust off the python code one my sons and I were working on, I found another project we had made together based on a lab in “Coding for Beginners Using Python” from Usborne.

This game was a bit different from our text dungeon.  As I recall this book had you do something fairly small with PyGame, I think it was flying a plane past some clouds or something - I don’t recall how deep it got honestly.

What I do recall is we wanted to go a bit further so we added:

- Controller support
- Our own sprites
- Some music
- Increasing difficulty and some randomness.

The whole idea of this version was to stay “alive” as long as you could and the score would keep going up, and the pace of objects (meteors, lasers) would get more chaotic.

This needs a controller plugged in to run (we didn’t do a lot of error checking) - and there are probably some issues with scoring, or the game loop - but I wanted to preserve it here anyway.

Maybe we’ll get back to it someday, but it was a fun memory!
